<p>I am a software developer, working on Python and Devops now. Its been a long time, since I have coded in Python. Lot of things have changed around here. There was some structure, there was some features, and much more.</p>
<p>I am using AWS for the first time. I did not think it was this easy. Let me try to deploy some Flask application next time..</p>

<h1>Ansible put to good use</h1>
<p>Hence, I have put Ansible to good use. Doing it with almost real world experience is splendid. I have now learnt to deploy in server. This feels so good.. </p>
