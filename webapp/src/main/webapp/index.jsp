<p>I am a software developer, working on Python and Devops now. Its been a long time, since I have coded in Python. Lot of things have changed around here. There was some structure, there was some features, and much more.</p>
<p>I am using AWS for the first time. I did not think it was this easy. Let me try to deploy some Flask application next time..</p>
